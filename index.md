Deerfield Academy will be hosting the DMC in the spring of 2026. The date is set to be 25 April this year.

# The Competition

The Deerfield Math Competition is a mathematics competition for middle school students. Established in 2017, DMC is hosted annually at Deerfield Academy in late April. DMC is entirely organized by student members of the Deerfield Academy Math Club. Inspired by the organizers' own experiences at math competitions, our original problems are intellectually challenging and help prepare students to compete at the high school level.
